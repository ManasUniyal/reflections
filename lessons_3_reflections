When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Working locally means that only we can view and edit the changes to the project. However, by hosting the
repository online, we can get help whenever we are stuck or can implement a new feature by other's aid. 
Moreover, when poeple working on a project can't share the same physical space, github is the best version
control system to collaborate. Github even has a user friendly GUI.
