What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Repository in general is a collection of related files. When we initialise a repository,
it becomes a git repository i.e. it now has it can now have it's own meta-data and previous
versions. By using the git init command, we create a normal repository into a git repository.
