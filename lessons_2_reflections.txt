What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Repository in general is a collection of related files. When we initialise a repository,
it becomes a git repository i.e. it now has it can now have it's own meta-data and previous
versions. By using the git init command, we create a normal repository into a git repository.

Staging area
Whenever we add a file to the staging area, git shows two classes of files, one which are 
changes to be commited. These are the files which have been added to the staging area and
the other are untracked files. These are the files in which changes have been made since the 
previous commit but have not yet been added to the staging area.
