When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Working locally means that only we can view and edit the changes to the project. However, by hosting the
repository online, we can get help whenever we are stuck or can implement a new feature by other's aid. 
Moreover, when poeple working on a project can't share the same physical space, github is the best version
control system to collaborate. Github even has a user friendly GUI.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

Git pushes and pulls branches. Therefore, automatically updating with your remote repository would mean 
that every branch is pulled, which is not what the user wants every time. Moreover, automatic updates would
create too many commits which will be troublesome for the user.
